/*Write a function, isPrime, that takes in a number as an argument. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not the given number is prime.

A prime number is a number that is only divisible by two distinct numbers: 1 and itself.

For example, 7 is a prime because it is only divisible by 1 and 7. For example, 6 is not a prime because it is divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 6.

if num is less than 2 return false because num less than 2 are not considered prime

use a for loop starting at 2 to list all of the numbers up to the number's square root. For example for 6 list 2,3

const isPrime = (num) => {
  if (num < 2){
    return false;
  }
  for(let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++){
    if(num % i === 0){
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
console.log("expect false", isPrime(8) );
console.log("expect true", isPrime(5));
console.log("expect true", isPrime(23) );
console.log("expect false", isPrime(1));
