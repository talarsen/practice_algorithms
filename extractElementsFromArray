/* Write a function that takes an array (a) as argument
Extract the first 3 elements of a
Return the resulting array
[1,2,3,4] => [1,2,3]
[5,4,3,2,1,0] => [5,4,3]
[99,1,1] => [99,1,1]
The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.
Big O notation: slice is O(N) where N is end - start*/

    return `array is empty`
  } else{
    return array.slice(0,3)
